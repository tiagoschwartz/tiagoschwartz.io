About Myself
Hi, I am Tiago Schwartz, a current third year at UC Santa Barbara majoring in Geography with an emphasis in GIS and also pursuing the TMP Certificate. Geography fascinates me because how applicable it is to anything in the modern world. Having a strong knowledge in geography, and especially in GIS can allow me to have a career in fields. Aside from academics I am an avid outdoorsman with my most recent backpacking trip being in the Pacific Northwest this past February.
